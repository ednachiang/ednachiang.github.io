I'm a science communicator, bioinformatician, and microbiologist with 6.5 years of research experience, 4 years of experience in managing a graduate program's social media, and extensive training in science communication and policy. I love uncovering hidden stories in science, using data to inform decisions, and sharing science through writing, public engagement, and visualizations.

As a microbiology PhD student with PhD minors in life sciences communication and biotechnology, I have expertise in communicating to diverse audiences ranging from scientific journals to policymakers through writing, public speaking, and data analysis.

I will graduate in summer 2022 and am seeking job opportunities where I can use my research and communication background to help make evidence-based decisions and make complex ideas accessible to diverse audiences.
